    role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Try makes if  easy to share code to try new things. It 
    aims to draft a solution to address a very specific issue, maybe
    the issue of one user only. That user  can access the code by
    installing the issue-specific snapshot of __try__ 
    (GitHub Flow: https://goo.gl/vzrfgy), which may be associated to
    one pull request. This should avoids sharing code, from developer
    to user, by email.
