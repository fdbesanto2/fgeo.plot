# Overview

Try makes if  easy to share code to try new things. It aims to draft a solution to address a very specific issue, maybe the issue of one user only. That user  can access the code by installing the issue-specific snapshot of __try__ (GitHub Flow: https://goo.gl/vzrfgy), which may be associated to one pull request. This should avoids sharing code, from developer to user, by email.



# Installation

Install from GitHub with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "forestgeo/try@some-issue")
```

The argument `repo` of `devtools::install_github()` can be in the format username/repo[@ref|#pull], where `ref` could be a commit, tag, or branch name, or a call to `github_pull()`.
