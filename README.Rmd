# Overview

Try makes if  easy to share code to try new things. It aims to draft a solution to address a very specific issue, maybe the issue of one user only. That user  can access the code by installing the issue-specific branch of __try__ (GitHub Flow: https://goo.gl/vzrfgy). This should avoids sharing code, from developer to user, by email.

# Installation

# Example installing branch of issue #142

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/try#142")
```
