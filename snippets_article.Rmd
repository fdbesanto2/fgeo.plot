# Dependencies

Table 1: Census 7 of Barro Colorado Island (released in 2012 and publicly available from https://goo.gl/HUuBwg). `tab_ab12`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
